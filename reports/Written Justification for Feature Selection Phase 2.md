Written Justification for Feature Selection Decisions (≈250 words)
Feature selection in Phase 2 was driven by a multi-faceted approach to reduce multicollinearity, enhance model stability, and retain predictive power in the fused multi-modal dataset. Initially, the correlation heatmap identified pairs with |corr| >0.85, such as struct_hours_worked ↔ struct_tasks_completed (indicating redundancy in workload metrics) and behav_collaboration_score ↔ behav_peer_interaction_score (overlapping social behavior signals). To quantify this, VIF analysis was performed, revealing 13 features with VIF >10 — signaling high collinearity that could inflate variance in regression-based ensembles planned for Phase 3.
Features were removed strategically: from structured data, struct_hours_worked, struct_efficiency_score, struct_deadline_met_score, and struct_client_satisfaction_score were dropped as they correlated strongly with core productivity indicators like struct_tasks_completed and struct_average_task_quality, preserving essential information without duplication. In behavioral logs, behav_collaboration_score, behav_peer_interaction_score, behav_task_followup_score, and behav_punctuality_score were eliminated due to overlap with behav_work_engagement_score and behav_initiative_score, focusing on intrinsic motivation over redundant interpersonal traits. For audio, audio_speaking_speed and audio_speech_clarity_score were removed, as they aligned closely with audio_speech_sentiment_score, streamlining communication proxies.
This pruning reduced the feature set from 24 to 14, minimizing noise while retaining high-importance elements (e.g., struct_average_task_quality at 0.124 Gini). Random Forest retraining confirmed the selected features maintained strong signal, with structured metrics dominating but cross-modal contributions (e.g., audio_speech_sentiment_score at 0.045) emerging. The decisions balance interpretability for HR insights, computational efficiency, and generalization, setting a robust foundation for Phase 3 optimization.
